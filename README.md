# Introduction
Fully considering climate comprehensiveness, heterogeneity and zonality, we propose a data-driven local climate zoning approach, whose kernel is regional aggregation based on the landform patch. There are four core steps:

0.	Data Processing
1.	Climatological Information Extraction
2.	Regional heterogeneity Measurement
3.	Local Climate Regionalization

See the Article "Local climate Regionalization of the Tibetan Plateau: a data-driven scale-dependent analysis" (under review) for detailed method description.
